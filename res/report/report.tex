\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Up to $\sim$2000 characters briefly describing the project.
\end{abstract}

\section{Goal/Requirements}

Detailed description of the project goals, requirements, and expected outcomes.
%
Use case Diagrams, examples, or Q/A simulations are welcome.

\subsection{Scenarios}

Informal description of the ways users are expected to interact with your project.
%
It should describe \emph{how} and \emph{why} a user should use / interact with the system.

\subsection{Self-assessment policy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How should the \emph{quality} of the \emph{produced software} be assessed?
    
    \item How should the \emph{effectiveness} of the project outcomes be assessed?
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements Analysis}

Is there any implicit requirement hidden within this project's requirements?
%
Is there any implicit hypothesis hidden within this project's requirements?
%
Are there any non-functional requirements implied by this project's requirements?

What model / paradigm / techonology is the best suited to face this project's requirements?
%
What's the abstraction gap among the available models / paradigms / techonologies and the problem to be solved?

\section{Design}

This is where the logical / abstract contribution of the project is presented.

Notice that, when describing a software project, three dimensions need to be taken into account: structure, behaviour, and interaction.

Always remember to report \textbf{why} a particular design has been chosen.
Reporting wrong design choices which has been evalued during the design phase is welcome too.

\subsection{Structure}

Which entities need to by modelled to solve the problem?
%
(UML Class diagram)

How should entities be modularised?
%
(UML Component / Package / Deployment Diagrams)

\subsection{Behaviour}

How should each entity behave?
%
(UML State diagram or Activity Diagram)

\subsection{Interaction}

How should entities interact with each other?
%
(UML Sequence Diagram)

\section{Implementation Details}

Just report interesting / non-trivial / non-obvious implementation details.

This section is expected to be short in case some documentation (e.g. Javadoc or Swagger Spec) has been produced for the software artefacts.
%
This this case, the produced documentation should be referenced here.

\section{Self-assessment / Validation}

Choose a criterion for the evaluation of the produced software and \textbf{its compliance to the requirements above}.

Pseudo-formal or formal criteria are preferred.

In case of a test-driven development, describe tests here and possibly report the amount of passing tests, the total amount of tests and, possibly, the test coverage.

\section{Deployment Instructions}

Explain here how to install and launch the produced software artefacts.
%
Assume the softaware must be installed on a totally virgin environment.
%
So, report \textbf{any} configuration step.

Gradle and Docker may be useful here to ensure the deployment and launch processes to be easy.

\section{Usage Examples}

Show how to use the produced software artefacts.

Ideally, there should be at least one example for each scenario proposed above.

\section{Conclusions}

Recap what you did

\subsection{Future Works}

Recap what you did \emph{not}

\subsection{What did we learned}

Racap what did you learned

\section*{Stylistic Notes}

Use a uniform style, especially when writing formal stuff: $X$, X, $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathcal{X}$, \texttt{X} are all different symbols possibly referring to different entities. 

This is a very short paragraph.

This is a longer paragraph (notice the blank line in the code).
It composed by several sentences.
%
You're invited to use comments within \texttt{.tex} source files to separate sentences composing the same paragraph.

Paragraph should be logically atomic: a subordinate sentence from one paragraph should always refer to another sentence from within the same paragraph.

The first line of a paragraph is usually indented.
%
This is intended: it is the way \LaTeX{} lets the reader know a new paragraph is beginning.

Use the \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Source_Code_Listings}{\texttt{listing}} package for inserting scripts into the \LaTeX{} source.
